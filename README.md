# Hunting for exoplanets using Machine Learning
This notebook attempts to predict if a star hosts an exoplanet or not using the KNN algorithm. Transit photometry method is used to detect exoplanets. Kaggle's [Kepler Space Telescope Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data) is used for this task.
